This model is modified based on the publishcation of Zakem, including 2 phytoplanktons with different nutrient preference, and uptake threshold is settled for numerical stability. Additionally, light inhibition on nitrifiers kinetics is explicitly parameterized for differentiate the controlling factor of light and substrate on the oxidized rate.
